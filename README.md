# Compose Multiplatform Coil Sample


This is a simple https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html project that uses [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/) framework to share UI across Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web. It showcases how to add and use the [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) image loading library in a KMP project. It also integrates [Ktor engine](https://ktor.io/docs/client-engines.html) that is required by Coil to be able to load images from a remote source.


This is a companion sample to my article on integrating Coil in Compose Multiplatform: https://medium.com/@domen.lanisnik/loading-images-with-coil-in-compose-multiplatform-4c94e16a06d7
